    <h2>Sorting Algorithms Overview</h2>
    
    <p>Sorting algorithms are fundamental building blocks in computer science that arrange data in a specific order. Understanding sorting algorithms is crucial because:</p>
    
    <ul class="key-points">
        <li>They demonstrate core algorithm design principles like divide-and-conquer and incremental improvement</li>
        <li>They teach us about algorithm analysis and tradeoffs between time and space complexity</li>
        <li>They are essential for optimizing data retrieval and processing in real applications</li>
    </ul>
